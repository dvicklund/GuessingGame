<!--A simple guessing game by David Vicklund - Aug. 4, 2015
    *
    * This assignment took somewhere around an hour and a half to complete while
    * somewhat distracted.
    *
    * I do not have any particular questions regarding this project, though
    * I will note that the odds of winning this game are somewhat low and it
    * probably won't be won without cheating.  What can I say, rock stars are
    * generally unpredictable and promiscuous.
    *
    * Also, there is one small bug - if the user enters anything other than a
    * number for their guess, the script believes that they have won...  and I
    * do not know what to do about that.

    <p>This stupid little game is the proud brainchild of the CEO and founder of Vicklund Ventures, <a href="https://soundcloud.com/dvicklund"><em>legendary</em> musician</a>, and expert chef David Vicklund.  Born in 1988 in Boulder, Colorado, he built his first computer at the age of seven, his first web app at 18, and his first robot at 23.  <sup>They grow up so fast, dont they?</sup>  His skills are currently expanding include <a href="https://www.codefellows.org/">Full-Stack JavaScript Development</a> and electronic music production (unrelated).</p>
    <p>Trained in the culinary arts for a decade in a dojo in the foothills of the Cascade Mountains, he makes his living wielding sharp blades with precision and speed, slicing through the flesh of animals and plants and marrying flavors together in delicious harmony for the delight and sustenance of the local townfolk.</p>
