<!--A simple guessing game by David Vicklund - Aug. 4, 2015
    *
    * This assignment took somewhere around an hour and a half to complete while
    * somewhat distracted.
    *
    * I do not have any particular questions regarding this project, though
    * I will note that the odds of winning this game are somewhat low and it
    * probably won't be won without cheating.  What can I say, rock stars are
    * generally unpredictable and promiscuous.
    *
    * Also, there is one small bug - if the user enters anything other than a
    * number for their guess, the script believes that they have won...  and I
    * do not know what to do about that.
