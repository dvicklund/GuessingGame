<!--A simple guessing game by David Vicklund - Aug. 4, 2015
    *
    * This assignment took somewhere around an hour and a half to complete while
    * somewhat distracted.
    *
    * I must note that the odds of winning this game are somewhat low - in fact it
    * probably won't be won without cheating.  What can I say, rock stars are
    * generally unpredictable and promiscuous.
